# BeeConnect

The Eik team is excited to introduce BeeConnect â€“ a student-driven project with the goal of creating a sensing-system for monitoring the beehives. The system will consist of a network of sensors that will collect a mesh of temperature data. This data will be transmitted to a database where it can be analyzed to hopefully improve bee health and honey production. 

The project is currently in the development phase, and we are working hard to create a prototype that can be tested in the field. We are confident that BeeConnect will be a valuable tool for beekeepers and will help contribute to the preservation of this important pollinator.
